## Introduction

This YouTube clone is a fullstack clone of the YouTube desktop website. The project is built in React.JS and has a Node.JS server that interacts with the YouTube Data API. I attempted to duplicate the styling and functionality of the original site but made a few modifications that I thought would improve the YouTube experience, such as picture-in-picture viewing of videos throughout the entire site. This clone is currently still in development.
