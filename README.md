## Introduction

This YouTube clone is a fullstack clone of the YouTube desktop website. The project is built in React.JS and has a Node.JS server that retrieves data from the YouTube Data API. 

I attempted to duplicate the styling and functionality of the original site but made a few modifications that I thought would improve the YouTube experience, such as picture-in-picture viewing of videos throughout the entire site. 

This project is currently still in development. 

Major Technologies:

- React
- Redux
- Node
